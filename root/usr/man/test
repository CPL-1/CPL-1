.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foo
is a text editor that I wrote. It is extremely simple to use,
yet powerful enough to compete with other editors like
.BR vi "(1) and " emacs "(1). Instead of making use of the CTRL and ESC keys, "
.BR foo " makes use of the F1-F12 keys, thus making it simple."

.PP
Note however that
.B foo "(1) is still in Beta testing mode, and may not work as expected. "
If you have any problems with it, please feel free to email me and let me know.
